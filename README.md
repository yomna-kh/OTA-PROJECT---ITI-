# OTA-PROJECT---ITI-
This project implements an OTA firmware update mechanism that allows devices to receive and install software updates. The project focuses on low-level programming, hardware-software interaction, and bootloader development.
# Project Overview
The OTA project aims to enable devices to receive firmware updates over the air, eliminating the need for manual intervention. It involves configuring system clocks, initializing peripherals, establishing UART communication, implementing a HexParser module, and developing a bootloader for seamless firmware updates.
# Features
System clock initialization for accurate timing.
Peripheral configuration (GPIO, USART2, FDI) for reliable communication.
UART initialization for establishing a communication channel.
HexParser module for decoding hexadecimal data received over UART.
Bootloader for erasing existing application code and writing updated firmware to flash memory.
